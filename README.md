# ANALYZING-HEART-DISEASE-CHOLESTEROL-USING-MULTIPLE-REGRESSION-LOGISTIC-REGRESSION
Heart disease is known to be one of the leading causes of death in United States. Statistically, about 1 out every 4 deaths are caused by heart disease. In this project, we analyze and build a statistical model that can classify if an individual has heart disease since early diagnosis of heart disease is a crucial task for many health care providers to help patients take extra precaution measures and reduce the effect of the disease. Besides heart disease, we will be investigating what causes the effects on cholesterol. Our body needs cholesterol. As a matter of fact, it makes cholesterol to make part of our body function correctly. The issue is when we add unnecessary cholesterol to our body by bad eating habits, smoking, or other unhealthy lifestyle. Consequently, we will look at the impact of certain factors we are interested on cholesterol based. 

We acquire the data “Heart Disease Cleveland UCI” from Kaggle. The data set contains 14 variables where 5 are numeric and 9 are categorical. In order to perform a proper analysis of our motivations, we can construct a series of questions that might be of interest to answer. By finding an answer to each of the questions, can aid us in finding associations and effects that each of the variables have on each other and ultimately answer our overall motive. Thus, we are interested in three questions in particular.

1. Does the cholesterol level for males and females depend on their age?
2. Given that the person has heart disease, what is the effect on cholesterol level?
3. How well can we classify heart disease of an individual?

Please refer to the Final Report for the details of the analysis and result.
